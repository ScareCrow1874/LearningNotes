The contenteditable Attribute


You can make an element editable by adding the contenteditable attribute in your markup. This attribute has three possible values: true, false, and inherit. Specifying inherit will make the element editable if it’s immediate parent is editable.
<div id="editor" contenteditable="true">
  ...
</div>
As well as the contenteditable HTML attribute it is also possible to make an element editable using JavaScript. This involves two element properties:


isContentEditable – This property will return true if the element is editable and false if it is not.

contentEditable – This property can be used to set the editable status of an element. Supported values are the same as those used for the contenteditable attribute: true, false, and inherit.

var editor = document.getElementById('editor');
editor.isContentEditable;
editor.contentEditable = true;
