run a python file: python <FILENAME>

DEBUG python file? Use print!

Math operations (similar to other languages)
+, -, *,
/ is just integer part
% is the mod

A variable doesn't need to have a type when declaring it, e.g.
cars = 100 # a car variable

Print out variables:
- preferred way example: 
  car = 100
  truck = 200
  print "text {1},{0}".format(car, truck)

- older way:
  print "text %s, %s" %(car, truck)

- %r is raw, %s is string type

KEEP CONSISTENT

More Printing:
- formatter = "%r %r %r %r"
  
  print formatter % (1, 2, 3, 4) // This is just printing 1, 2, 3, 4

- print variables:
  print "Here is a car", car

// print multiple lines

  print """
  There's something going on here.
  With the three double-quotes.
  We'll be able to type as much as we like.
  Even 4 lines if we want, or 5, or 6.
  """
- Some escape characters:
  \\ \'  \"  \b  \n

Want to print in line?
Instead of
    print item
you do
    print item,

But this will give you trailing white space for each item. If you don't want them, you have to do this:

import sys
sys.stdout.write("xxx")


example
  bob = "Bob"
  cid = "Cid"
  age = "14"
  year = 1995

  print "My age is %r" %age
  print "My age is %s" %age
  print "The yer is %d " %year
  print "people: %s, %s" %(bob, cid)
  print "I like",bob, "yea" #You do not print spaces around the variable?

OUTPUT:
My age is '14'
My age is 14
The yer is 1995 
people: Bob, Cid
I like Bob yea
---
Take input from user:
e.g. age = raw_input("What is your age?")

Take input from command-line argument (unpack)
- e.g.
  from sys import argv #Sys is a module

  script, first, second, third = argv
  print "The script is called:", script
  print "Your first variable is:", first
  print "Your second variable is:", second
  print "Your third variable is:", third

  $python ex1.py Kaiyu Zheng HAHA
  OUTPUT:
  The script is called: ex1.py
  Your first variable is: Kaiyu
  Your second variable is: Zheng
  Your third variable is: HAHA

  If you do not specify the correct number of arguments, error occurs

PRINTING IS OVER
------------------------------
FILES

Read files;
- open file: open(FILENAME)
  e.g.
  txt = open("hi.txt")
  print txt.read()
  // To read a file’s contents, call f.read(size), which reads some quantity of data and returns it as a string. size is an optional numeric argument. 
  
- read and write:
  
    close() -- Closes the file. Like File->Save.. in your editor.
    read() -- Reads the contents of the file. You can assign the result to a variable.
    readline() -- Reads just one line of a text file.
    truncate() -- Empties the file. Watch out if you care about the file.
    write('stuff') -- Writes "stuff" to the file.

  e.g.
  txt = open("filename", "w")
  "w" open the file in write mode (truncating the file if it already exists); 
  "r" for writing (default)
  "a" for appending

  r	Opens a file for reading only. The file pointer is placed at the beginning of th	e file. This is the default mode.
  rb	Opens a file for reading only in binary format. The file pointer is placed at th	e beginning of the file. This is the default mode.
  r+	Opens a file for both reading and writing. The file pointer will be at the begin	ning of the file.
  rb+	Opens a file for both reading and writing in binary format. The file pointer wil	l be at the beginning of the file.
  w	Opens a file for writing only. Overwrites the file if the file exists. If the fi	le does not exist, creates a new file for writing.
  wb	Opens a file for writing only in binary format. Overwrites the file if the file 	exists. If the file does not exist, creates a new file for writing.
  w+	Opens a file for both writing and reading. Overwrites the existing file if the f	ile exists. If the file does not exist, creates a new file for reading and writi        ng.
  wb+	Opens a file for both writing and reading in binary format. Overwrites the exist	ing file if the file exists. If the file does not exist, creates a new file for 	reading and writing.
  a	Opens a file for appending. The file pointer is at the end of the file if the fi	le exists. That is, the file is in the append mode. If the file does not exist, 	it creates a new file for writing.
  ab	Opens a file for appending in binary format. The file pointer is at the end of t	he file if the file exists. That is, the file is in the append mode. If the file	 does not exist, it creates a new file for writing.
  a+	Opens a file for both appending and reading. The file pointer is at the end of t	he file if the file exists. The file opens in the append mode. If the file does 	 not exist, it creates a new file for reading and writing.
  ab+	Opens a file for both appending and reading in binary format. The file pointer i	s at the end of the file if the file exists. The file opens in the append mode. 	 If the file does not exist, it creates a new file for reading and writing.

 <><><><><><
  from os.path import exists
  // use another handy function -- exists
  exists(FILENAME) returns true if the file already exists

  You should immediately notice that we import another handy command named exists. This returns True if a file exists, based on its name in a string as an argument. It returns False if not. We'll be using this function in the second half of this book to do lots of things, but right now you should see how you can import it.

Read files line by line Pythonicly:
with open(...) as f:
    for line in f:
        <do something with line>

------------------------------
Functions, variables

def func_name(arg):
    # stuff
    return stuff

------------------------------
If and else:

people = 30
cars = 40

if cars > people:
    print "We should take the cars."
elif cars < people:
    print "We should not take the cars."
else:
    print "We can't decide."
------------------------------
For loop & lists

the_count = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]

# this first kind of for-loop goes through a list
for number in the_count:
    print "This is count %d" % number

change = [1, 'pennies', 2, 'dimes', 3, 'quarters']
# also we can go through mixed lists too
# notice we have to use %r since we don't know what's in it
for i in change:
    print "I got %r" % i

# we can also build lists, first start with an empty one
elements = []

# then use the range function to do 0 to 5 counts
for i in range(0, 6):
    print "Adding %d to the list." % i
    # append is a function that lists understand
    elements.append(i)

------------------------------
While loop:
i = 0
numbers = []

while i < 6:
    print "At the top i is %d" % i
    numbers.append(i)

    i = i + 1
    print "Numbers now: ", numbers
    print "At the bottom i is %d" % i

Dictionaries

>>> stuff = {'name': 'Zed', 'age': 39, 'height': 6 * 12 + 2}
>>> print stuff['name']
Zed
>>> print stuff['age']
39
>>> print stuff['height']
74
>>> stuff['city'] = "San Francisco"
>>> print stuff['city']
San Francisco

Dictionaries are another example of a data structure, and like lists they are one of the most commonly used data structures in programming. A dictionary is used to map or associate things you want to store to keys you need to get them. Again, programmers don't use a term like "dictionary" for something that doesn't work like an actual dictionary full of words, so let's use that as our real world example.
------------------------------
Modules, Classes, and Objects:

MODULES
Imagine I have a module that I decide to name mystuff.py and I put a function in it called apple. Here's the module mystuff.py:

# this goes in mystuff.py
def apple():
    print "I AM APPLES!"

Once I have this code, I can use the module MyStuff with import and then access the apple function:

import mystuff
mystuff.apple()

CLASS
class MyStuff(object):

    def __init__(self): # constructor
        self.tangerine = "And now a thousand years between"

    def apple(self):
        print "I AM CLASSY APPLES!"

OBJECT
thing = MyStuff()
thing.apple()
print thing.tangerine

INHERITENCE
class DerivedClassName(BaseClassName):
    <statement-1>
    .
    .
    .
    <statement-N>

Python supports a limited form of multiple inheritance as well. A class definition with multiple base classes looks like this:

class DerivedClassName(Base1, Base2, Base3):
    <statement-1>
    .
    .
    .
    <statement-N>

------------------------------
Tuple:

A tuple is a sequence of immutable Python objects. Tuples are sequences, just like lists. The only difference is that tuples can't be changed

The empty tuple is written as two parentheses containing nothing:

tup1 = ();

To write a tuple containing a single value you have to include a comma, even though there is only one value:

tup1 = (50,);
------------------------------

PDB: the Python Debugger:

>>> import pdb
>>> import mymodule
>>> pdb.run('mymodule.test()')
> <string>(0)?()
(Pdb) continue
> <string>(1)?()
(Pdb) continue
NameError: 'spam'
> <string>(1)?()
(Pdb)

Or you can run the debugger to debug a script by

python -m pdb myscript.py arg1 arg2 ...
