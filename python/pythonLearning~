run a python file: python <FILENAME>

Math operations (similar to other languages)
+, -, *,
/ is just integer part
% is the mod

A variable doesn't need to have a type when declaring it, e.g.
cars = 100 # a car variable

Print out variables:
- preferred way example: 
  car = 100
  truck = 200
  print "text {1},{0}".format(car, truck)

- older way:
  print "text %s" %car

KEEP CONSISTENT

More Printing:
- formatter = "%r %r %r %r"
  
  print formatter % (1, 2, 3, 4) // This is just printing 1, 2, 3, 4
