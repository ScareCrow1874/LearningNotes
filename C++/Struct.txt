Struct 

In C++ the only difference between a class and a struct is that members and base classes are by default private in classes, while in structs they default to public. So structures can have constructors, and the syntax is the same as for classes. 

e.g. 

struct Vertex { 
float x, y, z; 

// it can have a constructor 
Vertex(float x, float y, float z) { 
this->x = x; 
this->y = y; 
this->z = z; 
} 
} 

When you use it 
int main() { 
.... 
Vertex point_a(0.5, 0.5, 0.5); 

// if you don't have the constructor, you can 
Vertex point_a = {0.5, 0.5, 0.5}; 
}
