Declare Array in C++ header:

 c++ array declaration in a header: From Stackoverflow:
 No this is not possible. Array declarations in headers must have constant sized value. Otherwise it's impossible for constructs like "sizeof" to function properly. You'll need to declare the array as a pointer type and use new[] in the constructor. Example.

 class Test {
     int *a;
 public:
     Test(int size) {
        a = new int[size];
     }
     ~Test() { delete [] a; }
 private:
     Test(const Test& other);
     Test& operator=(const Test& other);
 };
