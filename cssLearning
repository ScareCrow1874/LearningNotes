The difference between `.class1.class2` and `.class1 .class2`:

Example:
.test .heading { font-weight: bold; }
Would apply to the <p> element here:
<span class="test"><p class="heading">Something</p></span>

The lack of space means that the element must have both classes for the rule to apply.

.heading.major { color: blue; }
Would apply to the <p> element here:
<p class="heading major">Major heading</p>
