Linux - learning

Unix-like computer OS

Linux comes consisting of
	- The Linux kernel
	- GNU software (e.g. utilities, editor, compilers)
	- GUI
	- Software management system (rpm, deb etc.)


Multi-user system

Terminal Login: Ctrl + Alt + F1
		Ctrl + Alt + F2

Filesystem:
	- Everything is mounted under a single "root" directory -/
	- "/home" represents "My Documents" in Windows
	- "/usr" most programs are installed in;
	- "/etc" system configurartion files' dir
    Filesystem Command:
	1) pwd : where you are;
	2) cd ::
	    1> cd or cd -/ : navigate to home directory
	    2> cd target : target directory is within current directory
	    3> cd .. : go back to parent dir
	    4> cd path/to/target : target to arbitary location
	    5> cd ~username/ : go to another user's home directory
	    6> cd - : go to the previous working directory;
	3) ls : list files and directories
	4) find basedir -name '*string*' : find the file(I am not sure)
	5) locate string : search files using Linux's database
    Directory/File Manipulation:
	1) mkdir dirname : make a new directory, with name dirname;
	2) rmdir dirname : remove an empty dir;
	3) rm file : delete file;
	4) mv oldFileName newFileName : rename a file
	5) cp file1 file2 : copy file1 to file2 (Overwrite file2)
	6) rm -r oldDir : delete a directory;

Network File System (NFS):
	- Allows a computer to access files over a net work as easily as if they were on its local disks;
	- File permission are determined by userID
	- Therefore user ID's must be the same on the NFS server and the clients
	- Server decides which client machines are allowed to connect

Andrew File System (AFS) :
	- Distributed file system (the former two are also)
	- Advantages over NFS in security and scalability
	- Not part of standard filesystem tools in Linux, need to have
	  client software and [Kernel modules] installed;
	  [I have already installed]
	- To get access to AFS (is to access "cell"), authenticated by password using >klog command
	- Access SLAC cell go to /afs/slac.stanford.edu

Cool Commands:
	Command line program to download items from the web:
	- wget:
	    1) wget URL : retrieve a single file
	    2) wget URL -O local_name : give the file a different [local name]
	    3) wget -i file : download a list of URLs from a text file containing a list of URLs
	
	Compression utility that
	> reduce file size
	> Multiple levels of compression (slower?) 
	- gzip:
	    1) gzip myplot.eps : compress file 'myplot.eps', and produce a compressed file 'myplot.eps.gz'
	    2) gunzip myplot.eps.gz : uncompress the file
	    3) gzip -# myplot.eps : change level of compression (# 1-9)
	
	Archive utility that
	> allows multiple files and even large directory structures to be archived into a single file   
	- tar:
	    1) tar -cf archive.tar mydir : 
		archive the 'mydir' directory and produce a file called 'archive.tar'
	    2) tar -zcf archive.tar.gz mydir :
		Interaction with gzip, to create compressed archives
		Sometimes compressed archives have extension .tgz
	    3) tar -tf archive.tar :
		list the contents of an archive
	    4) tar -xf archive.tar :
		extract an entire archive
	    5) tar -xf archive.tar filename :
		extract a specific file from an archive
		6) for i in *.tar.gz; do tar xvzf $i -C path/to/output/directory; done:
		extract many directories

Commands for text file:
	(Viewing files)
	- less:
	    > improved version of earlier program called 'more'
	    > allows searching
	    > Up and Down keys scroll file line by line
	    > "Ctrl + f" - forward page
	    > "Ctrl + b" - backward page
	    > Typing '/' allows you to type a searching string;
	    > Typing '?' does the same but search is backward;
	    > 'q' to quit;
	- cat:
	    > quickly viewing a short file (Cannot search)
	    > typically used to pipe the content of a file to another command for processing
	- head/tail:
	    > prints the first/last n lines of files;
	      e.g. head -n 3 xxx.dat : print first 3 lines of file xxx.dat
	    > For tail: more available options like:
	      e.g. tail -f -s 5 xxx.txt :
		1) -f : output append data as file grows
		2) -s S : sleep for S sec between iterations

	(Others)
	- grep:
	    > used to search and print patterns (match/not) in files
	    > can be used to filter files directly by part of file name
	      e.g. grep "e-" particles_a.dat : find all electrionentries
	      e.g. grep -v "e-" particles_a.dat : find not match
	      e.g. grep e[+-] particles_a.dat : find e+ and e-
	- diff:
	    > used to compare files line by line and present any difference found
	      e.g. diff -q fileA fileB : quickly check if they differ
	      e.g. diff -y --suppress-common-lines \ fileA fileB :
		   Able to see differing lines in fileA and fileB
	      e.g. diff - u fileA fileB : output a unified diff ??
	- cut:
	    > removes sections from each line of a file and output the
	      removed sections as required
	      e.g. cut -d, --delimiter=DELIM : use DELIM to separate output fields;  
	      e.g. cut -f, --fields=LIST : use LIST as a comma-separated list of output fields
	      e.g. cut --output-delimiter=DELIM : use DELIM to separate output fields;

Chaining Commands:	
	- General:"
	    > Linux enables this chaining through I/O redirection
	    > e.g. Redirect output of a command to a file:
	      	   grep "e-" particles_a.dat > elec.dat;
	    > e.g. Finds all lines with e- and prints only their first field:
	           grep "e-" particles_a.dat | cut -f 1
	- xargs:
	    > Allows you to use the output of one command as the command line argument for another
	    > e.g. ls *.dat | grep particles | xargs diff -q
	- sed:
	- awk:
	    > a programming language
	    > e.g. swap order of output fields, like cut did:
	      awk '{print $2,$1}' particles_a.dat

(n) for name

TUTORIAL 1:
ls 	list files and directories
ls -a 	List All
cd + 	directory : open directory;
cd / 	go back to root;
cd - 	???
pwd 	to see what the directory you are in
mkdir (n) make directory
rmdir (n) remove directory (No ask), only works when it is empty;
rm -R (n) Remove everything in the directory, as well as the directory itself
nano basic text file/editor exists in each directory

Ex1
    list directories in ascending order of their size:
	du -sm * : get a list with size of each directory in a folder
	du -sm * | sort -nr : sort what's got in reverse order -r and numeric -n / string -s
	du -sm * | sort -nr | head -15 return top 15 largest items
	(du stands for Disk Usage)
	OR:
	ls -s
    Other du commands:
	du -h [path] --> provide human readable format of disk usage
	ls -lSr

Chaining Commands:
	';' separate commands to execute them sequentially;
	'&' run several commands all at once (put this at the end of the command line)
	'|' the 'pipe', used to make the output of the former command as the input of the latter command. e.g. ls | less

---
Remember, the terminal shell on this Ubuntu is called BASH;

For loop in Bash:

It makes life so easy. Here is an example:

for i in */
do
   echo $i;
done

What is this doing? It is looping over all the directories in the current location;
Certainly the 'echo $i' can be changed to any bash command (the linux command). For example,

for t in *.tar
do
   tar -xf $t;
done

One more complicated example I did is that I want to run the .sh file in a number of directories, so I did this:

for d in */
do
   cd $d;
   bash *.sh;
   cd ..;
done

Notice how simple it is, and the way to use it is just thinking about each directory. So you need to do a complete enter-and-exit.

------------------------------
Manage processes

top - easiest way to find out what processes are running

ps - list processes
ps aux - list processes more thoroughly
ps axjf - list processes in tree view
pgrep process_nameL - a way to get the PID of a process

kill PID_of_target_process - attempt to kill a process
     If the program does not exit, then do this:
kill -KILL PID_of_target_process

------------------------------
Difference between
/bin
/sbin
/usr/bin
/usr/sbin
/usr/local/bin
/usr/loca/sbin
Please refer to the Filesystem Hierarchy Standard (FHS) for Linux for this.

    /bin

For binaries usable before the /usr partition is mounted. This is used for trivial binaries used in the very early boot stage or ones that you need to have available in booting single-user mode. Think of binaries like cat, ls, etc.

    /sbin

Same, but for scripts with superuser (root) privileges required.

    /usr/bin

Same as first, but for general system-wide binaries.

    /usr/sbin

Same as above, but for scripts with superuser (root) privileges required.

    if I'm writing my own scripts, where should I add these?

Neither of the above. Please use /usr/local/bin or /usr/local/sbin for system-wide available scripts. The local path means it's not managed by the system packages (this is an error for Debian/Ubuntu packages).

For user-scoped scripts, use bin/ in your home directory.

The FHS says for /usr/local:

    Tertiary hierarchy for local data, specific to this host. Typically has further subdirectories, e.g., bin/, lib/, share/.

------------------------------
Grep string from several files:

Do the following:

       grep -rnw 'directory' -e "pattern"

-r is recursive, -n is line number and -w stands match the whole word. Along with these, --exclude or --include parameter could be used for efficient searching. Something like below:

       grep --include=\*.{c,h} -rnw 'directory' -e "pattern"

This will only search through the files which have .c or .h extensions. Similarly a sample use of --exclude:

       grep --exclude=*.o -rnw 'directory' -e "pattern"

Above will exclude searching all the files ending with .o extension. Just like exclude file it's possible to exclude/include directories through --exclude-dir and --include-dir parameter, the following shows how to integrate --exclude-dir:

      grep --exclude-dir={dir1,dir2,*.dst} -rnw 'directory' -e "pattern"

This works for me very well, to achieve almost the same purpose like yours.
