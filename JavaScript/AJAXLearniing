What is AJAX?

AJAX is not a new programming language.
AJAX is a technique for creating fast and dynamic web pages.

AJAX = Asynchronous JavaScript and XML.

XMLHttpRequest Object
The XMLHttpRequest object is used to exchange data with a server
behind the scenes. This means that it is possible to update parts of a
web page, without reloading the whole page.

----------
Create a XMLHttpRequest Object:

var xmlhttp = new XMLHttpRequest(); // IE7+, Firefox, Chrome, Safari, and Opera

// Old versions of Internet Explorer (IE5 and IE6) uses an ActiveX Object:
var xmlhttp =new ActiveXObject("Microsoft.XMLHTTP");

var xmlhttp;
if (window.XMLHttpRequest)
  {  // code for IE7+, Firefox, Chrome, Opera, Safari
     xmlhttp=new XMLHttpRequest();
  }
else
  {  // code for IE6, IE5
     xmlhttp=new ActiveXObject("Microsoft.XMLHTTP");
  }

----------
Send a Request:

xmlhttp.open(METHOD, URL, ASYNC);
xmlhttp.send();

*Method: Get or Post.
       
GET is simpler and faster than POST, and can be used in most cases.

However, always use POST requests when:

   -  A cached file is not an option (update a file or database on the server)
   -  Sending a large amount of data to the server (POST has no size limitations)
   -  Sending user input (which can contain unknown characters), POST is
    more robust and secure than GET
*URL: the address of a file on the server
The file can be any kind of file, like .txt and .xml, or server 
scripting files like .asp and .php (which can perform actions on
the server before sending the response back).

With AJAX, the JavaScript does not have to wait for the server response, but can instead:

    - execute other scripts while waiting for server response
    - deal with the response when the response ready

*ASYNC: whether or not use asynchronous js (boolean)

ASYNC = true: Yea, execute other script while wating for the response
    You need to specify a function to execute when the response is
    ready in the onreadystatechange event:

  e.g. 
  xmlhttp.onreadystatechange=function()
  {
  if (xmlhttp.readyState==4 && xmlhttp.status==200)
    {
    document.getElementById("myDiv").innerHTML=xmlhttp.responseText;
    }
  }
xmlhttp.open("GET","ajax_info.txt",true);
xmlhttp.send();

ASYNC = false: Nop, dont execute other script untill a response is
               received
----------
Response:

To get the response from a server, use the responseText or responseXML
property of the XMLHttpRequest object.

responseText 	get the response data as a string
responseXML 	get the response data as XML data

Use responseText:
    document.getElementById("myDiv").innerHTML=xmlhttp.responseText;

If the response from the server is XML, and you want to parse it as an
XML object, use the responseXML property:
    xmlDoc=xmlhttp.responseXML;
    txt="";
    x=xmlDoc.getElementsByTagName("ARTIST");
(See quiz.js)

----------
Events:

onreadystatechange event:

When a request to a server is sent, we want to perform some actions based on the response.
The onreadystatechange event is triggered every time the readyState changes.
The readyState property holds the status of the XMLHttpRequest.

Three important properties of the XMLHttpRequest object:
onreadystatechange 	Stores a function (or the name of a function)
                        to be called automatically each time the
                        readyState property changes

   
readyState              Holds the status of the XMLHttpRequest. Changes from 0
                        to 4:
   
                        0: request not initialized
                        1: server connection established
                        2: request received
                        3: processing request
                        4: request finished and response is ready

status 	                200: "OK"
                        404: Page not found


When readyState is 4 and status is 200, the response is ready:
xmlhttp.onreadystatechange = function()
{
    if (xmlhttp.readyStage = 4 && xmlhttp.status = 200)
    {
        document.getElementById("myDiv").innerHTML=xmlhttp.responseText;
    }
}

AJAX with PHP:
You can play with the url. For example:
xmlhttp.open("GET", "getresponse.php?q="+str, true); 
                    // str is a variable in JS

in the php file, you can get the value of the str (argument on URL) by
using the $_REQUEST['q'] array

If you want the response to be a XML, just build it in the php!
