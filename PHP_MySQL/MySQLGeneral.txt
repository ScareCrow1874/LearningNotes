MySQL 

Database 

The overall container for a collection of MySQL data. 
Table 

A subcontainer within a database that stores the actual data. 
Row 

A single record within a table, which may contain several fields. 
Column 

The name of a field within a row. 

Crappy Windows Command-Line Access 
If you installed the EasyPHP WAMP as explained in Chapter 2, you will be able to access the MySQL executable from the following directory: 

cd C:\Program Files <x86>\EasyPHP...\binaries\mysql\bin\mysql -p -u root 

The command to show databases: 

SHOW databases; 

Notice there is a semicolon 

There are six different prompts that MySQL may present you with (see Table 8-2), so you will always know where you are during a multiline input. 
Table 8-2. MySQL’s six command prompts 

MySQL prompt 

Meaning 

mysql> 

MySQL is ready and waiting for a command 

-> 


Waiting for the next line of a command 

'> 


Waiting for the next line of a string started with a single quote 

"> 


Waiting for the next line of a string started with a double quote 

`> 


Waiting for the next line of a string started with a back tick 

/*> 


Waiting for the next line of a comment started with /* 
------------------------------- 

Cancel Commands: 

meaningless gibberish to mysql \c 

When you type that line in, MySQL will ignore everything you typed and issue a new prompt. 

MySQL Commands: 
case-Insensitive 

Create a database: 

CREATE DATABASE name; 

after created a database, you want to use it: 

USE name; 

Create Users 

To create a user, issue the GRANT command, which takes the following form (don’t type this in—it’s not an actual working command): 

GRANT PRIVILEGES ON database.object TO 'username@hostname' 
IDENTIFIED BY 'password'; 

This should be pretty straightforward, with the possible exception of the database.object part. What this refers to is the database itself and the objects it contains, such as tables 

E.g. 

GRANT ALL ON books.* TO 'kaiyu'@'localhost' IDENTIFIED BY '123abc'; 

What this does is allow the user kaiyu@localhost full access to the publications database using the password mypasswd. You can test whether this step has worked by entering quit to exit and then rerunning MySQL the way you did before, but instead of entering -u root -p, type -u kaiyu -p, or whatever the username is that you created. 

Create a table 

first, USE books; 

Then, type:	
CREATE TABLE classics ( 
author VARCHAR(128), 
title VARCHAR(128), 
price CHAR(4)) ENGINE MyISAM; 

the ENGINE MyISAM tells MySQL the type of database engine to use for this table. 

To check whether your new table has been created, type: 

DESCRIBE classics; 

Output: 
mysql> DESCRIBE classics; 
+--------+--------------+------+-----+---------+-------+ 
| Field | Type | Null | Key | Default | Extra | 
+--------+--------------+------+-----+---------+-------+ 
| author | varchar(128) | YES | | NULL | | 
| title | varchar(128) | YES | | NULL | | 
| price | char(4) | YES | | NULL | | 
+--------+--------------+------+-----+---------+-------+ 

What these columns mean: 
Field 

The name of each field or column within a table. 
Type 

The type of data being stored in the field. 
Null 

Whether a field is allowed to contain a value of NULL. 
Key 

MySQL supports keys or indexes, which are quick ways to look up and search for data. The Key heading shows what type of key (if any) has been applied. 
Default 

The default value that will be assigned to the field if no value is specified when a new row is created. 
Extra 

Additional information, such as whether a field is set to auto-increment. 

Data Types 

Data type Bytes used	 Examples 

CHAR(n)	 Exactly n (<= 255)	 CHAR(5) “Hello” uses 5 Bytes 
CHAR(57) “New York” uses 57 bytes 

VARCHAR(n)	 Up to n (<= 65535)	 VARCHAR(100) “Greets” uses 6 bytes 
VARCHAR(7) “Morning” uses 7 bytes 


The BINARY data type 

The BINARY data type is used for storing strings of full bytes that do not have an associated character set. For example, you might use the BINARY data type to store a GIF image (see Table 8-7). 

Data type Bytes used	 Examples 

BINARY(n) Exactly n (<= 255)	 As CHAR but contains binary data 
or BYTE(n) 

VARBINARY(n)	Up to n (<= 65535)	 As VARCHAR but contains 
binary data 

TEXT 
(Treated as a string with a character set) 
The differences between TEXT and VARCHAR are small: 

Prior to version 5.0.3, MySQL would remove leading and trailing spaces from VARCHAR fields. 

TEXT fields cannot have default values. 

MySQL indexes only the first n characters of a TEXT column (you specify n when you create the index). 

BLOB (Binary Large OBject) 
Treated as binary data—no character set 
BLOBs cannot have default values 

BLOB(n), Bytes used Up to n (<= 65535) 

Numeric data types: 

INT signed: (−2147483648 to 2147483647)	Unsigned: (0 to 4294967295); 
FLOAT	signed: −3.402823466E+38 to 3.402823466E+38 
DOUBLE or REAL signed: −1.7976931348623157E+308 to 
1.7976931348623157E+308 

To specify whether a data type is signed or unsigned, use the UNSIGNED qualifier. The following example creates a table called tablename with a field in it called fieldname of the data type UNSIGNED INTEGER: 

CREATE TABLE tablename (fieldname INT UNSIGNED); 

When creating a numeric field, you can also pass an optional number as a parameter, like this: 

CREATE TABLE tablename (fieldname INT(4)); 

But you must remember that, unlike BINARY and CHAR data types, this parameter does not indicate the number of bytes of storage to use. It may seem counterintuitive, but what the number actually represents is the display width of the data in the field when it is retrieved. It is commonly used with the ZEROFILL qualifier like this: 

CREATE TABLE tablename (fieldname INT(4) ZEROFILL); 

What this does is cause any numbers with a width of less than four characters to be padded with one or more zeros, sufficient to make the display width of the field four characters long. When a field is already of the specified width or greater no padding takes place. 

DATE & TIME 
Data Type Time/date format 

DATETIME	 '0000-00-00 00:00:00' 
DATE '0000-00-00' 
TIMESTAMP	 '0000-00-00 00:00:00' 
TIME '00:00:00' 
YEAR 0000 (Only years 0000 and 1901–2155) 

DATETIME and TIMESTAMP use the same format. The difference is, TIMESTAMP has a narrow range (1970 to 2037), but it can be set by the MySQL automatically 

If you don’t specify the value when adding a row, the current time is automatically inserted. You can also have MySQL update a TIMESTAMP column each time you change a row. 

AUTO_INCREMENT 

Causes MySQL to set a unique value for this column in every row, as described earlier. We don’t really have control over the value that this column will take in each row, but we don’t care: all we care about is that we are guaranteed a unique value. 

Adding the auto-incrementing id column at table creation 

CREATE TABLE classics ( 
author VARCHAR(128), 
title VARCHAR(128), 
type VARCHAR(16), 
year CHAR(4), 
id INT UNSIGNED NOT NULL AUTO_INCREMENT KEY) ENGINE MyISAM; 

You can also add a column after you create a TABLE 

ALTER TABLE classics ADD id INT UNSIGNED NOT NULL AUTO_INCREMENT KEY; 

It has the following characteristics 
INT UNSIGNED 

Makes the column take an integer large enough for you to store more than 4 billion records in the table. 
NOT NULL 

Ensures that every column has a value. Many programmers use NULL in a field to indicate that the field doesn’t have any value. But that would allow duplicates, which would violate the whole reason for this column’s existence. So we disallow NULL values. 
AUTO_INCREMENT 

Causes MySQL to set a unique value for this column in every row, as described earlier. We don’t really have control over the value that this column will take in each row, but we don’t care: all we care about is that we are guaranteed a unique value. 
KEY 

An auto-increment column is useful as a key, because you will tend to search for rows based on this column. This will be explained in the section Indexes. 

Adding data to a table 

INSERT INTO classics (author, title, type, year) 
VALUES('Mark Twain', 'The Adventure of Tome Sawyer', 'Fiction', '1876'); 

Rename a table 
ALTER TABLE classics RENAME pre1900 

Change data type of a column 
ALTER TABLE classics MODIFY year SMALLINT; 

Renaming a column 

Looking again at Figure 8-5, you may decide that having a column named type can be confusing, because that is the name used by MySQL to identify data types. Again, no problem—let’s change its name to category, like this: 

ALTER TABLE classics CHANGE type category VARCHAR(16); 

Note the addition of VARCHAR(16) on the end of this command. That’s because the CHANGE keyword requires the data type to be specified, even if you don’t intend to change it, and VARCHAR(16) was the data type specified when that column was initially created as type. 

Removing a column 

Actually, upon reflection, maybe the page count column pages isn’t actually all that useful for this particular database, so here’s how to remove that column using the DROP keyword: 

ALTER TABLE classics DROP pages; 

Remember that DROP is irreversible and you should always use it with caution 

Select data from column(s): 

If you want All: 

SELECT * FROM database; 

Add conditions: 

SELECT * FROM database WHERE some_column = some_value 
// you can use multiple conditions by specifying AND, OR relationships among them; 

Select specific column in some Order 

SELECT col_name, col_name2,... FROM database ORDER BY col_name 

Update data: 
UPDATE table_name 
SET column1=value1,column2=value2,... 
WHERE some_column=some_value; 

Delete a table 

DROP TABLE classics; 

Delete a row 

DELETE FROM table_name WHERE some_column = some_value 

Indexes 
The way to achieve fast searches is to add an index, either when creating a table or at any time afterward. But the decision is not so simple. For example, there are different index types, such as INDEX, PRIMARY KEY, and FULLTEXT. Also you must decide which columns require an index, a judgment that requires you to predict whether you will be searching any of the data in that column. Indexes can also get complicated, because you can combine multiple columns in one index. And even when you’ve decided that, you still have the option of reducing index size by limiting the amount of each column to be indexed. 

Create an Index 
ALTER TABLE classics ADD INDEX(author(20)); 
ALTER TABLE classics ADD INDEX(title(20)); 
ALTER TABLE classics ADD INDEX(category(4)); 
ALTER TABLE classics ADD INDEX(year); 
DESCRIBE classics; 

The first two commands create indexes on both the author and title columns, limiting each index to only the first 20 characters. For instance, when MySQL indexes the following title: 

The Adventures of Tom Sawyer 

It will actually store in the index only the first 20 characters: 

The Adventures of To 

This is done to minimize the size of the index, and to optimize database access speed. I chose 20 because it’s likely to be sufficient to ensure uniqueness for most strings in these columns. 

These two commands are equivalent 

ALTER TABLE classics ADD INDEX(author(20)); 
CREATE INDEX author ON classics (author(20)); 

Creating the table classics with indexes 

CREATE TABLE classics ( 
author VARCHAR(128), 
title VARCHAR(128), 
category VARCHAR(16), 
year SMALLINT, 
INDEX(author(20)), 
INDEX(title(20)), 
INDEX(category(4)), 
INDEX(year)) ENGINE MyISAM; 

------------------------------ 
Mastering MySQL 

Primary Keys: 
It is very important and useful to have relational databases, among which data are linked with each other; 
e.g. we may have three tables for author, book and customer and have them linked with each other in some way. 

Don’t choose a key that could possibly have the same value for different objects. The ISBN is a rare case for which an industry has provided a primary key that you can rely on to be unique for each product. Most of the time, you’ll create an arbitrary key for this purpose, using AUTO_INCREMENT. 

Normalization 

The process of separating your data into tables and creating primary keys is called normalization. Its main goal is to make sure each piece of information appears in the database only once 

Duplicated data make things very inefficient 

Luckily, E. F. Codd, the inventor of the relational model, analyzed the concept of normalization and split it into three separate schemas called First, Second, and Third Normal Form. If you modify a database to satisfy each of these forms in order, you will ensure that your database is optimally balanced for fast access, and minimum memory and disk space usage. 

**First Normal Form 
For a database to satisfy the First Normal Form, it must fulfill three requirements: 

1.There should be no repeating columns containing the same kind of data. 
2.All columns should contain a single value. 
3.There should be a primary key to uniquely identify each row. 

e.g. No repeated kind of data (Should be no 'Author1' and 'Author2') 

Note 

Keys (also called indexes) have several purposes in MySQL. The fundamental reason for defining a key is to make searches faster. You’ve seen examples in Chapter 8 in which keys are used in WHERE clauses for searching. But a key can also be useful to uniquely identify an item. Thus, a unique key is often used as a primary key in one table, and as a foreign key to link rows in that table to rows in another table. 

**Second Normal Form 
In order to achieve Second Normal Form, your tables must already be in First Normal Form. 

Second Normal Form is achieved by identifying columns whose data repeats in different places and then removing them to their own tables. (Note the Connection among different tables) 

**Third Normal Form 
Once you have a database that complies to both the First and Second Normal Forms, it is in pretty good shape and you might not have to modify it any further. However, if you wish to be very strict with your database, you can ensure that it adheres to the Third Normal Form, which requires data that is not directly dependent on the primary key but that is dependent on another value in the table should also be moved into separate tables, according to the dependence. 

For example, in Table 9-6, the Customers table, it could be argued that the State, City, and Zip code keys are not directly related to each customer, because many other people will have the same details in their addresses, too. However, they are directly related to each other, in that the street Address relies on the City, and the City relies on the State. 

Therefore, to satisfy Third Normal Form for Table 9-6, you would need to split it into Tables 9-8, 9-9, 9-10, and 9-11. 

**When not to use normalization? 
you should never fully normalize your tables on sites that will cause MySQL to thrash. 

Normalization requires spreading data across multiple tables, and this means making multiple calls to MySQL for each query. On a very popular site, if you have normalized tables, your database access will slow down considerably once you get above a few dozen concurrent users, because they will be creating hundreds of database accesses between them. 

In face Multiple updates can be computerized, though. MySQL provides a feature called triggers that make automatic changes to the database in response to changes you make. 

Relationships 
**One-to-One 

**One-to-Many 
One-to-many (or many-to-one) relationships occur when one row in one table is linked to many rows in another table 

**Many-to-Many 
In a many-to-many relationship, many rows in one table are linked to many rows in another table. To create this relationship, add a third table containing the same key column from each of the other tables. This third table contains nothing else, as its sole purpose is to link up the other tables. 

Transactions 

When making money transfers between bank accounts, it is vital that the order of the transaction is correct and each step is successful. In MySQL things cannot be undone but with this Transaction feature you can choose not to execute the command if it is not correct; 

In order to be able to use MySQL’s transaction facility, you have to be using MySQL’s InnoDB storage engine. This is easy to do, as it’s simply another parameter that you use when creating a table. 

CREATE TABLE accounts ( 
number INT, balance FLOAT, PRIMARY KEY(number) 
) ENGINE InnoDB; 

DESCRIBE accounts; 

The final line of this example displays the contents of the new table so you can ensure that it was correctly created. The output from it should look like this: 

+---------+---------+------+-----+---------+-------+ 
| Field | Type | Null | Key | Default | Extra | 
+---------+---------+------+-----+---------+-------+ 
| number | int(11) | NO | PRI | 0 | | 
| balance | float | YES | | NULL | | 
+---------+---------+------+-----+---------+-------+ 
2 rows in set (0.00 sec) 


Using BEGIN 

Transactions in MySQL start with either a BEGIN or a START TRANSACTION statement. 

BEGIN; 
UPDATE accounts SET balance=balance+25.11 WHERE number=12345; 
COMMIT; 
SELECT * FROM accounts; 

Using COMMIT 

When you are satisfied that a series of queries in a transaction has successfully completed, issue a COMMIT command to commit all the changes to the database. Until a COMMIT is received, all the changes you make are considered to be merely temporary by MySQL. This feature gives you the opportunity to cancel a transaction by not sending a COMMIT but by issuing a ROLLBACK command instead. 

Using ROLLBACK 

example: 

BEGIN; 
UPDATE accounts SET balance=balance-250 WHERE number=12345; 
UPDATE accounts SET balance=balance+250 WHERE number=67890; 
SELECT * FROM accounts; 

Once you have entered these lines, you should see the following result: 

+--------+---------+ 
| number | balance | 
+--------+---------+ 
| 12345 | 800.61 | 
| 67890 | 390 | 
+--------+---------+ 
2 rows in set (0.00 sec) 

// Hey I feel like things are not right 

ROLLBACK; 
SELECT * FROM accounts; 
+--------+---------+ 
| number | balance | 
+--------+---------+ 
| 12345 | 1050.61 | 
| 67890 | 140 | 
+--------+---------+ 
2 rows in set (0.00 sec) 

Using EXPLAIN 

MySQL comes with a powerful tool for investigating how the queries you issue to it are interpreted. Using EXPLAIN, you can get a snapshot of any query to find out whether you could issue it in a better or more efficient way. Example 9-6 shows how to use it with the accounts table you created earlier. 

Example: 

EXPLAIN SELECT * FROM accounts WHERE number='12345'; 

The results of this EXPLAIN command should look like the following: 

(expand window if not wide enough) 
+--+-----------+--------+-----+-------------+-------+-------+-----+----+-----+ 
|id|select_type|table |type |possible_keys|key |key_len|ref |rows|Extra| 
+--+-----------+--------+-----+-------------+-------+-------+-----+----+-----+ 
| 1|SIMPLE |accounts|const|PRIMARY |PRIMARY|4      |const| 1| | 
+--+-----------+--------+-----+-------------+-------+-------+-----+----+-----+ 
1 row in set (0.00 sec) 

The information that MySQL is giving you here is as follows: 

select_type 
The selection type is SIMPLE. If you were joining tables together, this would show the join type. 

table 
The current table being queried is accounts. 

type 
The query type is const. From worst to best, the possible values can be: ALL, index, range, ref, eq_ref, const, system, and NULL. 

possible_keys 

There is a possible PRIMARY key, which means that accessing should be fast. 
key 
The key actually used is PRIMARY. This is good. 

key_len 

The key length is 4. This is the number of bytes of the index that MySQL will use. 
ref 
The ref column displays which columns or constants are used with the key. In this case, a constant key is being used. 

rows 
The number of rows that need to be searched by this query is 1. This is good. 

Whenever you have a query that seems to be taking longer than you think it should to execute, try using EXPLAIN to see where you can optimize it. You will discover which keys, if any, are being used, their lengths, and so on, and will be able to adjust your query or the design of your table(s) accordingly. 

Backing Up and Restoring 

Using mysqldump 

With mysqldump, you can dump a database or collection of databases into one or more files containing all the instructions necessary to recreate all your tables and repopulate them with your data. It can also generate files in CSV (Comma-Separated Values) and other delimited text formats, or even in XML format. Its main drawback is that you must make sure that no one writes to a table while you’re backing it up. 

There are various ways to do this, but the easiest is to shut down the MySQL server before mysqldump and start up the server again after mysqldump finishes. 

Or you can lock the tables you are backing up before running mysqldump. To lock tables for reading (as we want to read the data), from the MySQL command line issue the command: 

LOCK TABLES tablename1 READ, tablename2 READ, ...; 

Then, to release the lock(s), enter: 

UNLOCK TABLES; 

By default, the output from mysqldump is simply printed out, but you can capture it in a file through the > redirect symbol. 

The basic format of the mysqldump command is: 

mysqldump -u user -ppassword database 
-------------------------------------------------

Creating a Backup File 

Now that you have mysqldump working, and have verified it outputs correctly to the screen, you can send the backup data directly to a file using the > redirect symbol. 

mysqldump -u user -ppassword database > database.sql 

$$Note 
The command in Example 9-8 stores the backup file into the current directory. If you need it to be saved elsewhere, you should insert a file path before the filename. You must also ensure that the directory you are backing up to has the right permissions set to allow the file to be written. 

The smart backup code(in the .sql file) can be used to restore a database from a backup, even if it currently exists, because it will first drop any tables that need to be recreated, thus avoiding potential MySQL errors. 

To back up only a single table from a database (such as the classics table from the publications database), you should first lock the table from within the MySQL command line, by issuing a command such as the following: 

LOCK TABLES publications.classics READ 

This ensures that MySQL remains running for read purposes, but writes cannot be made. Then, while keeping the MySQL command line open, use another terminal window to issue the following command from the operating system command line: 

mysqldump -u user -ppassword publications classics > classics.sql 

Example	Dumping just the classics table from publications 

$ mysql -u user -ppassword 
mysql> LOCK TABLES classics READ; 
mysql> QUIT 
$ mysqldump -u user -ppassword publications classics > classics.sql 
$ mysql -u user -ppassword

Restoring from a Backup File 

To perform a restore from a file, call the mysql executable, passing it the file to restore from using the < symbol. 

mysql -u user -ppassword < all_databases.sql 

To restore a single database, use the -D option followed by the name of the database, as in Example 9-12, where the publications database is being restored from the backup made in Example 9-8. 
Example 9-12. Restoring the publications database 

mysql -u user -ppassword -D publications < publications.sql 

To restore a single table to a database, use a command such as that in Example 9-13, where just the classics table, backed up in Example 9-9, is being restored to the publications database. 
Example 9-13. Restoring the classics table to the publications database 

mysql -u user -ppassword -D publications < classics.sql 

Dumping Data in CSV Format 

As previously mentioned, the mysqldump program is very flexible and supports various types of output, such as the CSV format. Example 9-14 shows how you can dump the data from the classics and customers tables in the publications database to the files classics.txt and customers.txt in the folder c:/web. By default, on an EasyPHP 3.0 installation, the user should be root and no password is used. 

Example 9-14. Dumping data to CSV format files 

mysqldump -u user -ppassword --no-create-info --tab=c:/web 
--fields-terminated-by=',' publications 

This command is quite long and is shown here wrapped over two lines, but you must type it all in as a single line, ensuring there is a space between web and --fields. The result is the following: 

Mark Twain (Samuel Langhorne Clemens)','The Adventures 
of Tom Sawyer','Classic Fiction','1876','9781598184891 
Jane Austen','Pride and Prejudice','Classic Fiction','1811','9780582506206 
Charles Darwin','The Origin of Species','Non-Fiction','1856','9780517123201 
Charles Dickens','The Old Curiosity Shop','Classic Fiction','1841','9780099533474 
William Shakespeare','Romeo and Juliet','Play','1594','9780192814968 

Mary Smith','9780582506206 
Jack Wilson','9780517123201 

&The golden rule to backing up is to do so as often as you find practical. &

Other Techniques: 

What if you want to have a column that store strings with really really big length? VARCHAR seems not to be a good solution; 

Now, it's time to checkout TEXT and LONGTEXT 

TINYTEXT - 255 bytes 
TEXT - 65535 bytes 
MEDIUMTEXT - 16,777,215 bytes (2^24 - 1) 
LONGTEXT - 4G bytes (2^32 – 1) 

TINYBLOB - 255 bytes 
BLOB - 65535 bytes 
MEDIUMBLOB - 16,777,215 bytes (2^24 - 1) 
LONGBLOB - 4G bytes (2^32 – 1) 

Date and time type: 

When creating a table you can do this: 

CREATE TABLE Orders 
( 
OrderId int NOT NULL, 
ProductName varchar(50) NOT NULL, 
OrderDate datetime NOT NULL DEFAULT NOW(), // !!! You don't need to worry, time will be automatically recorded! 
PRIMARY KEY (OrderId) 
)

--------
Quotes and such

because the server reads x as a value as it is wrap with single quote. backtick escapes a reserved keyword used within the query, usually it is used to wrap around columnNames and tableNames.

in your query,

SELECT `id` FROM `table` WHERE 'x' = '$y'

x there is not a column but a string value.
