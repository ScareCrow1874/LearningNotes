1. Where is the 'default location'
 - I assumed it is the location in the parenthesis (home/qaz2wsx3/.ssh/id_rsa
 - I backed up the original id_rsa
2. Where to clone?
 - I clone it to /var/www because the contents in this repository needs to work on a server; Yet this still says permission denied(publickey) (I added the SSH key to the Bitbucket and used sudo). 
   The reason is that I have the ssh keys in the home directory, but not in /root/.ssh
 - so I chose to clone it to ~/uwit. It succeeded
3. no info on .htpasswd
