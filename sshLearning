SSH: Secure Shell

 sudo service ssh restart

SSH, which is an acronym for Secure SHell, was designed and created to provide the best security when accessing another computer remotely.

First. You need to know the Shell Account of Somebody's linux machine

ssh url -l username:
login as username

ssh-keygen
Generate a ssh key. Note this key has its passphrase

ssh-keygen -t dsa
generate key with encryption method DSA

Copy a file from one machine to another (local-remote or remote-remote)

scp (-r) /path/to/file /path/to/destination

if the path is remote, do host:path
e.g. qaz2wsx3@wefwef:path/destination
